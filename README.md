This project presents a bidirectional DC motor speed controller using PWM generated by an NE555 timer and a MOSFET H bridge. The goal was to design a low cost, fully discrete circuit able to control motor speed and direction while handling start up current safely.

Project Objectives
• Generate PWM using NE555
• Control motor speed with adjustable duty cycle
• Enable forward and reverse rotation
• Handle high start-up current safely
• Protect the circuit with fuse and NTC thermistor

Circuit Description
The NE555 is configured as a PWM generator. The duty cycle is adjusted using a potentiometer and diode network, allowing independent charge and discharge paths for better PWM control. The PWM output drives an H bridge made from IRF4905 (P channel high side) and IRF3205 (N channel low side) MOSFETs. A switch selects motor direction by controlling which MOSFET pair is active. A large capacitor on the supply stabilizes voltage and reduces ripple.
The pchannel mosfet 4905 receive 8v on source and is on when volt on source > gate and it acts like a switch off when voltage on source is equal voltage on gate so this is the high side switches
On the low side switch 3205 mosfets they pass to gnd so they are like a closed switch when the gate receives voltage but when not it’s a open circuit
